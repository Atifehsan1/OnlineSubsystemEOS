This repository contains the source code that accompanies a soon to be released tutorial series on the course: [The EOS Online Subsystem (OSS) Plugin](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/1px/unreal-engine-online-services-the-eos-online-subsystem-oss-plugin/Lnjn/unreal-engine-online-services-introduction).

## Requirements

The solution in this repository is a C++ Unreal Engine project targetting version 5.1. The code should be compatible with UE versions 4.27 and later. To build the project you will need a source or binary build of Unreal Engine. You will also need to have set up Visual Studio for working with Unreal Engine C++ project. See [Setting Up Visual Studio](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/). 

## Usage

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

1. If you're using a source build of Unreal Engine, build your engine. 
2. In the root folder, right-click on the .uproject file and select "Generate Visual Studio Project Files". 
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio, and build it. 

**The course is a walkthrough on how this code was written.**
